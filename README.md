## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Node.js 18.17 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jaceleedev/qr-code-component.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd qr-code-component
   ```

3. Install dependencies using pnpm:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

## My process

### Built with

- Next.js (v14.2.5)
- TypeScript (v5)
- Tailwind CSS (v3.4.1)
- CSS Modules
- CSS BEM methodology
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SEO & web accessibility

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my skills in Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I learned the importance of project structure, specifically how creating folders named after components and using index.tsx files can simplify imports. This was a new insight compared to my previous project. This structure enhances the maintainability and readability of the code, making it easier to manage and scale.

#### Code snippets:

```bash
components
└── QRCode
    ├── index.tsx
    └── index.module.css
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to deepen my expertise in Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with a particular focus on optimizing project structure and embracing component-based architecture. My goal is to build more accessible and performant web applications, prioritizing seamless user experiences and scalable codebases.
